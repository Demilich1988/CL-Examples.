//There was a reoccurring error on the semi-finished machine of 3rd party software creating empty plan data with a spec but no planned amount or result ammount this was causing errors when the machine would try to change spec. After consulting the vendor and hearing that it would take a number of weeks to solve the problem I added this Java Script code to the MES project to allow users to delete this false plan data. 

/* Added else if so that users can delete Finish / Current      */
			 //Else if for Current if result and plan = 0
			else if (dsList.getColumn(dsList.rowposition, "status") == "C" &&
					utlf_getNullToZero(dsList.getColumn(dsList.rowposition, "resultCnt")) == 0 &&
					 utlf_getNullToZero(dsList.getColumn(dsList.rowposition, "planCnt")) == 0
					 )
				{
					this.dtsf_deleteRow(dsList);
				}
				//Else if for finished if result and plan = 0
				else if (dsList.getColumn(dsList.rowposition, "status") == "F" &&
					utlf_getNullToZero(dsList.getColumn(dsList.rowposition, "resultCnt")) == 0 &&
					 utlf_getNullToZero(dsList.getColumn(dsList.rowposition, "planCnt")) == 0
					 )
				{
					this.dtsf_deleteRow(dsList);
